    <p>A grapevine leaf roll is a dish consisting of cooked grapevine leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings.<br/> Stuffed vine leaves without meat are sometimes called yalancı dolma, which means "liar's dolma" in Turkish. Vişneli yalancı dolması is a variation of stuffed vine leaves where the rice is seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, and mint. The dolmas are slowly cooked together with morello cherries (vişne), and plums may also be used.</p>

    <p>Shish Barak can be considered the ravioli of Arabic cuisine; they look just like them, except the stuffing must be minced meat, and the sauce it is cooked in is yogurt-based to be considered traditional. Often, ground beef or lamb or even a mixture is used to make this hearty meal.<br/>Making the filling and the dough is the easiest part. It is the tedious repetition of making the shish barak dumplings by hand. </p>
